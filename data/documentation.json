      "description": "You are invited on a journey of rethinking, reinterpreting, re-inventing myth and tradition. Paintings entice viewers to contemplate the serene yet foreboding scenes, where the natural elements of light and clouds suggest the work of invisible forces.\n\nThese landscapes evoke a sense of biblical sublimity and monumental presence, blending stillness and motion akin to ancient prophecies. Ruins and pathways within these landscapes hint at unknown histories and futures. Hughes navigates the delicate balance between the sublime and the comic, invoking the inevitable paradoxes of reaching the divine. His work speaks to the complexity of human perception, where the grand narratives of mythology are made strange through a blend of pop culture and kitsch, sci-fi and eroticism, serenity and sublimity, figuration and painterly abstraction; drawing on multiple references and traditions as a foundation for innovation.",

      "description": "A theatre of paint leads the viewer on a journey. Flowers, rocks and horizons have become alive and greet the viewer as they pass. Symbols from mythology, literature and history, as well as formal elements, intertwine in a vortex of imaginative fantasy. These landscapes have a primordial bodily impact on the viewer as they generate the illusion of space and atmospheric effects. We can't help but feel the resonance of a yellow mist or a black mountain. This experiential veil of being is pierced by the painterly application that unapologetically delights in the daubs, drips and drenches of pure pigments and mediums. Aside from the abstractions even some of the symbolic and figurative elements appear to have lost their way and stepped out of their allocated genre. \n\nIn a talismanic world of flowering meaning everything is mind, every plant, mountain and cloud. All substance - malleable and flowing - in a simultaneous ‘now’ that stretches to forever. Evolving into a free flowing psychic soup. It teeters on the brink between utopia and apocalypse. Each painting is a circus troupe of avatars that hope to meet and dance with the avatars of your experience. \n",
